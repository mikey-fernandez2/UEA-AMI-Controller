"""
This class simulates the first order dynamic of one muscle. The dynamic is also compensated by neural network
Muscle dynamic model is from The paper
"Shin D, Kim J, Koike Y (2009) A myokinetic arm model for estimating joint torque and stiffness from EMG signals during maintained posture. Journal of Neurophysiology, 101(1):387–401. https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.00584.2007"
Follings are the values for reference of each parameter modified for lower extrimity from the paper:
K0, N/m 2000
K1, N/m 40000
L0, m   0.03
L1, m   0.006
M,  m   (0.01, 0.05)TA, (-0.03, -0.01)PL    I should use opensim to find better initial value.
